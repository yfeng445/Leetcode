# Problem Statement

You are given a string `S` of length `N` which encodes a non-negative number `V` in a binary form. Two types of operations may be performed on it to modify its value:

- If `V` is odd, subtract 1 from it.
- If `V` is even, divide it by 2.

These operations are performed until the value of `V` becomes 0.

For example, if string `S = "011100"`, its value `V` initially is 28. The value of `V` would change as follows:

- `V = 28`, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 14.
- `V = 14`, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 7.
- `V = 7`, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 6.
- `V = 6`, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 3.
- `V = 3`, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 2.
- `V = 2`, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 1.
- `V = 1`, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 0.

Seven operations were required to reduce the value of `V` to 0.

## Task

Write a function:

```java
class Solution {
    public int solution(String S);
}
```

Given a string `S` consisting of `N` characters containing a binary representation of the initial value `V`, the function should return the number of operations after which its value will become 0.

## Examples

1. **Input:** `S = "011100"`
   **Output:** `7`
   Explanation: String `S` represents the number 28, which becomes 0 after seven operations, as explained above.
2. **Input:** `S = "111"`
   **Output:** `5`
   Explanation: String `S` encodes the number `V = 7`. Its value will change over the following five operations:
   * `V = 7`, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 6.
   * `V = 6`, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 3.
   * `V = 3`, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 2.
   * `V = 2`, which is even: divide by 2 to obtain 1.
   * `V = 1`, which is odd: subtract 1 to obtain 0.
3. **Input:** `S = "1111010101111"`
   **Output:** `22`
4. **Input:** `S` consisting of "1" repeated 400,000 times
   **Output:** `799,999`

## Constraints

* The string `S` is made only of the characters `'0'` and/or `'1'`.
* `N`, which is the length of string `S`, is an integer within the range `[1..1,000,000]`.
* The binary representation is big-endian, i.e., the first character of string `S` corresponds to the most significant bit.
* The binary representation may contain leading zeros.

# Verified Code and Explanation

## Code

```java
public int NumOfOperationsToConvertToZero(String s){
    int i = s.length - 1;
    int numOperations = 0;

    while (i > 0){
        numOperations++;
        if (s[i] == '1'){
            numOperations++;
        }
        i--;
    }
    if (s[i] == '1') numOperations++;
    return numOperations;
}
```


## Explanation

1. Start from the least significant bit (rightmost).
2. Iterate through the binary string.
3. Increment operations count by 1 for each bit (base case).
4. Increment additional operation when encountering a '1' (subtraction case).
5. Special check for the most significant bit (leftmost) to ensure all bits are processed.

The algorithm is **optimal** with `O(N)` time complexity since it processes each bit exactly once.
